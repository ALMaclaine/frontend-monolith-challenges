## Questions

### Are there any downsides to doing e2e testing using a tool like cypress for monolithic frontend applications
Focusing solely on the downsides of E2E testing for monolithic frontend applications, we can identify several challenges:

1. Monolithic architecture: Monolithic frontend applications bundle all the code and components into a single package. This structure can make E2E tests more difficult to write, maintain, and debug due to the intertwined nature of the codebase and the higher number of dependencies.

2. Scalability issues: As monolithic frontend applications grow, the time it takes to execute E2E tests may increase significantly. This can lead to slower feedback loops and extended development cycles, negatively affecting the development process.

3. Increased test complexity: In monolithic applications, changes in one component can sometimes have unintended consequences on other components. This can make it more challenging to identify the root cause of E2E test failures, increasing the time and effort required for troubleshooting.

4. Lower modularity: Monolithic frontend applications tend to have lower modularity, which can make it more difficult to isolate individual components during E2E testing. This lack of isolation can make it harder to identify specific areas of the application that are responsible for test failures.

5. Resource consumption: E2E tests for monolithic frontend applications may consume more resources compared to those for modular applications. This is because the entire application needs to be loaded and interacted with during the test, which can put a strain on the testing infrastructure.

6. Difficulty in parallelization: E2E tests for monolithic frontend applications may be harder to parallelize due to the tightly coupled nature of the code. This can lead to longer test execution times and reduced efficiency in the testing process.

7. Test data management: Managing test data for a monolithic frontend application can be more challenging, as the entire application shares the same data store. Ensuring test data consistency and isolation across various test scenarios may be more difficult, which can lead to unreliable test results.

8. Test environment setup: Setting up and maintaining test environments for monolithic frontend applications can be more complicated, as it typically requires deploying the entire application. This can increase the time and effort required for test environment management.

9. Reduced agility: Monolithic frontend applications can hinder agility in the development process. Due to the size and complexity of the codebase, it may take longer to implement and test new features or updates. This can slow down the overall development process and make it harder to adapt to changing requirements or user feedback.

10. Maintenance overhead: As monolithic frontend applications grow in size and complexity, maintaining E2E tests can become increasingly burdensome. This can lead to test suites that are difficult to maintain and update, potentially resulting in outdated or ineffective test coverage.

11. Documentation challenges: Comprehensive documentation is crucial for effective E2E testing, but it can be more difficult to create and maintain for monolithic frontend applications. The complexity and interdependencies of the codebase can make it harder to document all aspects of the application, which can hinder the effectiveness of the E2E tests.

12. Dependency on external systems: Monolithic frontend applications often rely on various external systems and services, making E2E tests more susceptible to failures caused by issues with these dependencies. This can lead to false negatives in test results, making it harder to identify genuine issues within the application.

13. Limited test reusability: Due to the tightly coupled nature of monolithic frontend applications, E2E tests may be less reusable across different parts of the application. This can result in increased redundancy and maintenance efforts, as developers may need to create multiple similar tests for different scenarios.

14. Version control challenges: In a monolithic frontend application, all components are part of the same codebase, which can make version control more complicated. This complexity can affect E2E testing, as it can be harder to manage multiple branches, merge code changes, and maintain a clean history of the application's evolution.

15. Increased risk of regression: Since monolithic frontend applications are typically more interconnected, changes to one part of the application can have unintended consequences on other parts. This can increase the risk of regression, making E2E testing even more critical to ensure the application's overall functionality remains intact.

16. Difficulty in isolating performance issues: E2E tests for monolithic frontend applications may not be as effective in pinpointing performance issues, as the tests often involve multiple components working together. This can make it challenging to identify which part of the application is causing performance problems.

17. Communication challenges: In a monolithic frontend application, developers often need to communicate and collaborate more closely to ensure E2E tests are effective. This can be challenging, especially in larger teams or when working remotely, and may result in miscommunications or misunderstandings that affect the quality of the tests.

18. Test prioritization: With the complexity and interdependencies of monolithic frontend applications, it can be more difficult to prioritize which parts of the application to test first. This challenge can lead to inefficient testing processes and, in some cases, inadequate test coverage.

19. Test automation limitations: Automating E2E tests can be more challenging for monolithic frontend applications, as the tightly coupled nature of the codebase can make it harder to create modular, reusable test scripts. This can result in less efficient test automation and increased maintenance efforts.

20. Cross-browser and cross-device testing: Monolithic frontend applications may present additional challenges when it comes to cross-browser and cross-device testing. The complexity of the application can make it harder to identify and resolve compatibility issues, potentially affecting the user experience on different platforms.

To address these challenges, developers should consider adopting a balanced testing strategy that includes unit, integration, and E2E tests. Additionally, they may want to explore refactoring the monolithic frontend application into a more modular architecture, which can help reduce some of the complexities associated with E2E testing.

### Does adding e2e tests to a poorly architected app generally lead to that poor architecture being hardened
Expanding on the concept of hardening poor architecture through tightly coupled e2e tests:

End-to-end tests that are tightly coupled to the existing poor architecture can inadvertently reinforce and perpetuate problematic design choices. Tightly coupled e2e tests typically focus on the specific implementation details of the architecture, which means they are closely linked to the way the code is currently structured. This can create a dependency between the tests and the existing design, making it difficult to refactor or improve the application without also modifying the tests.

When developers attempt to refactor or restructure the code, they may encounter failing e2e tests, even if their changes would lead to a better-designed and more maintainable application. This is because the tests are written in such a way that they expect the code to be structured in a particular manner. As a result, developers might be deterred from making necessary architectural improvements or might need to spend considerable time and effort updating the tests to work with the new design.

Over time, this can result in a more rigid and less adaptable codebase, as the e2e tests essentially "lock in" the poor architecture. This situation can lead to a more fragile and less maintainable application, as developers are less likely to make important architectural changes for fear of breaking the e2e tests.

To address this issue, developers should aim to create e2e tests that are less reliant on specific implementation details and more focused on the desired user experience and outcomes. By writing tests that are more flexible and adaptable, it becomes easier to refactor and improve the code without having to constantly update the tests. This approach helps to maintain a healthy balance between ensuring the application functions as intended from a user perspective, while still allowing for necessary architectural improvements to be made without being hindered by the tests.
